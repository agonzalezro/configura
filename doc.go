// variables, but it will also let you set some defaults.

// If you already know "The twelve-factor methodology" (see: http://12factor.net/)
// you will be aware of their third point: http://12factor.net/config were they
// highly recommend to use environment variables to all the configs in your app. I
// will also add that using docker this way of storing the configuration is quite
// handy and some times allows you to avoid other techniques like: ansible,
// puppet, chef...
